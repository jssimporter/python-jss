                kwargs:
                    {1}

                    Some classes allow additional filters, subsets, etc,
                    in their queries. Check the object's `allowed_kwargs`
                    attribute for a complete list of implemented keys.

                    Not all classes offer all types of searches, nor are
                    they all necessarily offered in a single query.
                    Consult the Casper API documentation for usage.

                    In general, the key name is applied to the end of the
                    URL, followed by the val; e.g.
                    '<url>/subset/general'.

                    Some common types of extra arguments:

                    subset (list of str or str): XML subelement tags to
                        request (e.g.  ['general', 'purchasing']), OR an
                        '&' delimited string (e.g.
                        'general&purchasing').  Defaults to None.
                    start_date/end_date (str or datetime): Either dates
                        in the form 'YYYY-MM-DD' or a datetime.datetime
                        object.

            Returns:
                QuerySet: If data=None, return all objects of this
                    type.
                {0}: If searching or creating new objects, return an
                    instance of that object.
                None: (FUTURE) Will return None if nothing is found that
                    matches the search criteria.

            Raises:
                GetError for nonexistent objects.
