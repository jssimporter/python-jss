    DistributionPoints is an object which reads DistributionPoint
    configuration data from the JSS and serves as a container for
    objects representing the configured distribution points.

    This class provides an abstracted interface for uploading packages
    and dmg's to file repositories.

    PLEASE NOTE: Not all DistributionPoint types support all of the
    available methods, or in the same way. For example, a JDS has
    caveats to the reliability of the exists() method.

    Support for Local repositories, AFP/SMB shares and JDS and CDP
    servers are included, and are selected based on configuration files.

    This object can copy files to multiple repositories, avoiding the
    need to use Casper Admin to "Replicate" from one repository to
    another, as long as the repositories are all configured correctly.

    See the individual Repository subclasses for information regarding
    type-specific properties and configuration.
