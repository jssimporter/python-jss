    configuration data from the JSS and serves as a container for objects

    This class provides a unified object for copying, deleting, and moving
    packages and dmg's to file repositories.

    Support for AFP/SMB shares, HTTP(S) distribution points, and JDS' are
    included, and are selected based on configuration files.

    This object can copy files to multiple repositories, avoiding the need to
    use Casper Admin to "Replicate" from one repository to another, as long as
    the repositories are all configured correctly.

    See the individual Repository subclasses for information regarding
    type-specific properties and configuration.
